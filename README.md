# ValidationAPI Password form 

Using the validationAPI to make use of client sided form validation. To give the user clear and immediate feedback for their form inputs in an attempt to increase conversion rates.
This form checks to see if the userâ€™s password meets the following requirements:
*	16-100 characters (longer is better)
*	At least one of these symbols: !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *
*	At least one number
*	At least one lowercase letter
*	At least one uppercase letter
